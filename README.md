A toolbox that provides functionality to perform changepoint analysis (CPA) on data containing time-tagged events. 
Initially developed for time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) measurements, but the principle holds generally for all types of events. 
The full description of the method will be uploaded to arXiv shortly.
